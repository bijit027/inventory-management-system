=> Must Disable user Registration on demo site using a middleware onlyReadOperation
   onlyReadOperation will return false if the http method of the incoming request is not a GET method.
   That means it disable POST, PUT, UPDATE, PATCH & DELETE method



=> Run CreateApp seeder or its generated sql for the first time of installation of application.
   That means only for version 1.0.0 .
   CreateApp seeder will seed admin role and all permissions.
   Don't run it in version upgrades.

   Run DevDemo seeder for creating demosite for showcase the site and for testing in development mood.

   Difference between DevDemo and CreateApp is CreateApp only seed superadmin and roles,permissions where
   DevDemo also create superadmin and role, permissions with necessary demo data for other modules.

   If you want that your users will get some demo data for example currencies you can add that seeders
   in your CreateApp seeder.

   Don't include truncate function in individual seeder classes. Suppose you need to truncate
   all currencies in version 2.3.4 upgrade file. Then truncate the currencies in that file first
   and run the currencies seeder file.

   If any new permission need to add in new version released after 1.0.0
   then seed the permissions from the dedicated version upgrade file.
   Don't run CreateApp seeder in version upgrades.



=> Never Try to jump a new version from an older version directly. Suppose current version
   is 2.0.1 and your desired version is 5.0.0. You should upgrade to all version one by one
   between this two versions. This will persist the consistency of the application


=> When a person fill Registration form he will be assigned to subscriber role. If Admin assign him to any role

=> Products have unit, sell unit, purchase unit. Without choosing unit value user can not
   choose purchase and sell unit. Only units which has no base  unit that means only base units
   will be shown in the unit choose list. Then in sell unit and purchase unit , units will be
   showed which base unit id is equal to the our chosen unit id

=> Hide now sale unit and purchase unit for simplicity purpose. Now Products sale and purchase units will
   be equal to its unit

=> Place ConvertEmptyStringsToNull middleware after PreventXSS middleware.
   Otherwise It will fail to convert empty string to NULL
